# Contributing to TENET AI

Thank you for your interest in contributing to TENET AI! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## 🎯 Project Vision

TENET AI is a defensive security middleware for LLM applications. Our goal is to make AI systems safer by detecting and preventing adversarial attacks like prompt injection, jailbreaks, and data extraction attempts.

## 📐 Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

We follow [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/) with these specifications:

- **Line length**: 100 characters
- **Formatting**: Use Black (automatic)
- **Linting**: Use Ruff
- **Type hints**: Required for public functions
- **Docstrings**: Google style

**Example:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def detect_threat(
    prompt: str,
    threshold: float = 0.8
) -> Optional[dict]:
    """Detect threats in a prompt.
    
    Args:
        prompt: The user's input prompt to analyze
        threshold: Detection threshold (0.0 to 1.0)
        
    Returns:
        Detection result dict if threat found, None otherwise
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If threshold is out of range
    """
    if not 0.0 <= threshold <= 1.0:
        raise ValueError(f"Threshold must be 0-1, got {threshold}")
    
    # Implementation...
    return result
```

### Testing Standards

- **Coverage**: Aim for 70%+ on new code
- **Test types**: Unit tests for all detection logic
- **Naming**: `test_<function>_<scenario>`
- **Structure**: Arrange-Act-Assert pattern

**Example:**
```python
def test_detect_prompt_injection_returns_high_score():
    # Arrange
    detector = PromptInjectionDetector()
    malicious_prompt = "Ignore all previous instructions"
    
    # Act
    detected, confidence, patterns = detector.detect(malicious_prompt)
    
    # Assert
    assert detected is True
    assert confidence > 0.8
    assert len(patterns) > 0
```

## 🚀 Release Process

TENET AI uses automated semantic versioning via [git-cliff](https://git-cliff.org/) and GitHub Actions.

### How Releases Work

1. All commits must follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format
2. When a maintainer pushes a version tag, the release pipeline runs automatically
3. Changelog is generated from commit messages
4. GitHub Release is created with the changelog
5. Docker image is published to GitHub Container Registry
6. Python package published to PyPI for stable releases only — rc/beta/alpha tags skip PyPI

### Version Tag Format
v1.0.0         — stable release
v1.0.0-rc.1    — release candidate
v1.0.0-beta.1  — beta release
v1.0.0-alpha.1 — alpha release

### Commit Types and Their Effect

| Commit Type | Example | Version Bump |
|-------------|---------|--------------|
| `feat:` | `feat: add new detector` | Minor (1.x.0) |
| `fix:` | `fix: resolve false positive` | Patch (1.0.x) |
| `feat!:` | `feat!: breaking API change` | Major (x.0.0) |
| `docs:` | `docs: update README` | No bump |
| `chore:` | `chore: update deps` | No bump |
| `perf:` | `perf: optimize detection` | No bump |
| `refactor:` | `refactor: clean up analyzer` | No bump |
| `test:` | `test: add unit tests` | No bump |
| `security:` | `security: patch vulnerability` | No bump |

### Creating a Release (Maintainers Only)
```bash
# Create and push a version tag
git tag v1.2.3
git push origin v1.2.3
# The release workflow runs automatically
```
